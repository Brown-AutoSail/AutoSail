# AutoSail
AutoSail is a ML auto tunner for Istio service mesh



## Application

Sockshop: See [here](/Application/Sockshop/README.md) for documentation



## Notebooks

We used Jupyter Notebooks as the initial prototype for easy debug and observability. These notebooks can be found [here](/Notebooks).

`Env.ipynb`,  `IstioParam.ipynb`,  `LoadGenerator.ipynb`, `Prometheus.ipynb`, `Request.ipynb` are where we test individual components of the AutoSail system.

`Main.ipynb` combines everything together. If you wish to run AutoSail, [this](/Notebook/Main.ipynb) is probably what you are looking for.
